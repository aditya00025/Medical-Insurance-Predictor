# Medical-Insurance-Predictor
 
 # Overview

The Medical Health Insurance Prediction project aims to analyze and predict insurance costs based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and region. By leveraging data preprocessing and machine learning models, the project helps in understanding how different attributes impact insurance charges.

# Dataset

The dataset consists of the following features:

Age: Age of the individual

Sex: Gender (encoded as 0 for female, 1 for male)

BMI: Body Mass Index

Children: Number of children covered by health insurance

Smoker: Smoking status (encoded as 0 for yes, 1 for no)

Region: Geographical region (encoded as 0 for southeast, 1 for southwest, 2 for northeast, 3 for northwest)

Charges: Medical insurance cost (target variable)

# Tools & Libraries Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)

Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization

# Insights & Findings

Smokers tend to have significantly higher insurance costs

Higher BMI may contribute to increased charges

Age and number of children also impact insurance costs

# Conclusion

This project provides insights into medical insurance cost factors and helps predict charges using machine learning models. The analysis can aid insurance companies in assessing risk and pricing policies effectively.
